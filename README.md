# GitAndroidAPI
 It's an Android application in Java that can retrieve a list of repositories from the GitHub API (https://api.github.com).


The application is divided into 2 parts:

a view with a search field and a list to display the repositories retrieved from the GitHub API,

a view with a second list to display branch and contributors with their profile image.
